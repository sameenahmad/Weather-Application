# Weather-Application
 Developed a Mobile-Based(502x507) Web Application which uses Openweather 3rd party API to fetch the temperature of user specified location. I tried implementing Fetch and .then methods to handle request from api calls.  The App shows Temperature, min temp, max temperature on all 3 scales(Celcius, fahrenheit and Kelvin) depending on user(s) choice.
Different HTML pages haven't been stiched together because I was still learning the front end part of the project. They have stacked on top of each other and can be rendered with ease once the backend is created for different end points.
