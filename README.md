# Weather-Application
Developed a Mobile Only Web Application which uses Openweathers's API to fetch the temperature of user specified location. 

I have user Fetch and promises to handle request from api calls. 

The App shows Temperature, min temp, max temperature on all 3 scales(Celcius, fahrenheit and Kelvin) depending on user(s) choice.

Different HTML pages haven't been stiched together because I was still learning the front end part of the project. 

Check out the version of it built in react here:
